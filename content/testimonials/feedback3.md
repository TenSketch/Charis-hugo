I love my planet earth and I am going to do anything for it. I do campaigns and write journals about greener and less toxic world. Jute bags are part of my life, but the bags from the Charis Bag's made me happy, because itâ€™s not just eco-friendly but also stylish. I can't explain how much I loved it. I thanked my friend a lot.
