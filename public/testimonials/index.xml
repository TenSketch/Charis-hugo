Their customized bags are simply marvelous. It’s eco-friendly, and so trendy.I can&amp;rsquo;t explain how much I loved it. I thanked my friend a lot and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to thank you too Charis Bags.</description>

      <description>I am quite picky about my bags. When my friend told me about fashion bags from Charis Bags, I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention. Well, it was my birthday last night, and she gave me one of those bags as a gift. I can&amp;rsquo;t explain how much I loved it. I thanked my friend a lot and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to thank you too Charis Bags.</description>
